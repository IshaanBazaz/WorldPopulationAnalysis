The target is to analyse the data to see trends of world population. We would like to know which countries has a major rise in their population and how the world population has changed across decades. 

### Tools used:
- Power BI – Version June 2019 (2.70.5494.561)
- Excel 2016

### Steps:

- **Extraction:** This step involved downloading the dataset from online public [source](https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/sp.pop.totl)

- **Transformation:** The dataset obtained had to be cleaned before using. There were many unwanted data which were removed like it contained population data divided by income level. It also had population about continents, which were deleted. 

- **Loading:** The dataset was loaded onto Power BI for analysis. The Power BI version was June 2019 (2.70.5494.561). We changed the data type according to data contained and applied filters to further clean the data.

- **Charts created:** After all the steps, we drew some charts using Power BI.

### Charts:
First page of the Power BI report consists of four charts:
- The first chart is a bar graph, showing world’s population of 1960, 1980, 2000, 2017.
- The second chart is a pie chart, displaying population of all countries. If you click on a particular country, it also acts as a filter for rest of the charts on the page.
- The third and fourth charts are world map showcasing population of the world in year 1960 and 2017 with bubble sizes according to the population of a country.

Second page of the Power BI report consists of eight charts:
- The first four graphs show the population of top 5 countries for each 20-year gap period from 1960 to 2017, so the years are 1960, 1980, 2000 and 2017. We can see that China, Indian and United States were always top 3 in that particular record.
- The first four graphs show the population of bottom 5 countries for each 20-year gap period from 1960 to 2017, so the years are 1960, 1980, 2000 and 2017
